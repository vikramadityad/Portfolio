      <p>
        As an ambitious and driven entrepreneur, I founded a healthcare startup called ServUs Health in 2017 
        based on my research at the University of New Brunswick. From conducting beta and pilot studies to 
        achieving seed-ready status, I have played a crucial role in every step of the building process. 
        Collaborating with my skilled technology team, I not only responsible for the product development & 
        strategy but also honed my own coding skills. As a result, I am proud to have become a proficient 
        full-stack developer with a well-rounded perspective on building successful businesses.
